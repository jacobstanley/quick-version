* List all functions in a package, and their types

* List the subset of those functions for which all inputs
have an Arbitrary instance

* Generate a list of arbitrary inputs to those functions

* Record the outputs

* For each function, create a hash of type++inputs++outputs

* Hash the list of all function hashes as the API hash

The list of exported function hashes is the API.

For a revdep, it can be determined what subset of the full API is
required, so whether a future version breaks compat can be determined.

Storing a history of all API hashes, including all function inputs used,
can be used to determine version dependency bounds in revdeps, and
version age (non-breaking additions) numbers.
