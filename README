QuickVersion

quick-version is a tool for generating and comparing Haskell library API
fingerprints.

The goal is to provide automatic discovery of API changes between package
versions. A hash is generated for every visible function and type, and
this list of hashes can be used to automatically check compatibility of a
reverse-dependency against the subset of the API which is actually used.
